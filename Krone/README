This is a firmware for a clone for an educational robotic kit that I
used in my university.  It was made so that we could have more control
of the robot movement, which wasn't possible with the firmware provided
with the kit controller board.  The board was also smaller, which was
useful.

This is also pre-Arduino, but this repository conveniently existed.

As far as I know, this is the latest firmware version.  Original dates
are as follows:
